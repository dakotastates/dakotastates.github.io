<p>I am a pessimistic idealist who strives for a better world but doesn't actually do much to change it. Secretly I am a horrible person, but a lot of us are. All jokes aside, I am a baker who idiotically studied applied environmental sociology, screen studies, and political science without consideration of the future job prospects. Currently trying to learn new skills to help my future employability.  Perhaps in the future I will master the art of self deprecation. </p>
