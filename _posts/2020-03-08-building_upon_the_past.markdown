It has been quite the week for this pessimistic idealist. First off I knew I had to create my cli project but I had no idea what to do my project on. I had some ideas but none of them seemed right. But then I become ill. I live in Seattle which is ground zero for Covid-19 here in the united states. Now I am not certain if I had the Corona Virus or not but my doctor seemed to believe it was a real possibility. With that in mind, I didn’t start my project until the Thursday before it was due as being sick does not make it easy to focus on coding. However, being sick gave me an idea for my CLI project. I figured I could simply scrape information off of some website regarding the Covid-19 virus and create an CLI with that information. But simple it was not. 

I am still learning how to code but I know how to scrape data within reason. At first it was pretty easy getting the basics out of the way. But then came the table. The table, when scraped, gave me an array of all the data in one large array. I sorted through the array and figured out that since there were 7 columns in the table I should create a nested array sorting the data by 7. I called each new array a country because that was all the data associated with a particular country. And guess what. It worked. Though I had to use ‘xpath’ as opposed to ‘search’ in order for it to work. I went to bed excited as it was finally coming together. 

The next day however, I didn’t change anything. I simply reran my cli and there were extra numbers. Where did they come from? I had no idea. I spend most of the day trying to figure out why. Until it dawned on me. The website changed. It not only changed the data, as expected, it also changed the number of columns on the table. That would explain the extra number. The fix was simple. Change my 7 to an 8 and add assign the new columns data its down method. 

The moral of the story is things change and we have to sometimes deal with it. But why do things change? Because they are not perfect. We build upon the past in order to create something closer to perfection. We want the most ideal tables, codes, stories, blogs, food, etc we can develop. And there is nothing wrong with imperfection but without trying to improve something we remain the same. It gets stagnant and boring. We don’t stimulate our curiosity. And we are failing at learning everything we can about everything. We want to solve every problem we can think of because in the long term, it makes for a better world.
