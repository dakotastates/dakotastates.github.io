How would you describe the most ideal form of the future? If you could erase our current social and political construction and create a new ideal world to your liking, what would it look like? And what from our current world would you keep? Would there be poverty? War? Pollution? Income Inequality? Racism? An excessive amount of questions? Hopefully not. 

Most rational people would agree these issues, along with many other issues, are not ideal. So, as we create our ideal forms of the future, we have to take into consideration not just what we want but how we want to achieve it. For example, if we want to solve the issue of poverty, what solutions would be available? You could have a communistic society were everyone is the same and subsequently have the same government issued products (not ideal); you could give everyone money! (seemingly ideal but it gets messy when we assess where the money comes from); or perhaps we allow technology to automate the production of materials with the hope of bringing the cost of materials to literally zero, and then use said materials to produce costless products capable of allowing everyone, regardless of wealth, the ability to live their lives without the need for money (complicated, but we are getting there). The point is, a lot of what we create comes out of nothing. We use our skills and ingenuity to help create what we perceive to be ideal. And nothing is ideal at first. It takes trial and error but if we keep building upon the past, perhaps one day, we will create something capable of solving some of the world’s most dire problems.

So, what are we doing about the issues facing the world today? There are those out there who are actively trying to solve various issues; however, most of us are too absorbed into our own lives to seek solutions to these issues (unless the issue directly affects you). This is common, as most of us assume someone else is taking care of these issues (whether it be the government, a random mad scientist stored away in the secret laboratory Tesla style, or the awesome sister in the film "Black Panther"). “If someone else is trying to solve these issues there is no need for me to try. They got this”. 

The sad truth is, these issues are real and those who are actively trying to solve them can’t do it by themselves. It takes ingenuity, time, and lots of failure. It often takes building upon the past to create something new. We should not assume someone else is capable of solving these issues. Instead perhaps we should try to solve the issues we want solved ourselves. There is no harm in trying. Personally, when I see a homeless person sleeping on the sidewalk or a river clearly polluted with chemicals from a nearby oil rig, I want to do something about it; but I don't know how and I like many others assume someone else is taking care of it. I think it's time to learn some skills and hopefully be able to solve a few problems independently. 

And so, the subject of this blog deals with the role of technology, primarily software engineering, in solving the issues facing the world.  I invite the readers of this blog to join me as I attempt to enlighten myself to the role of technology in problem solving and perhaps become more than just a passive observer who assumes someone else will make a problem a thing of the past.  My tool of choice in joining the ranks of problem solver is a computer; and more specifically, software engineering as taught by the Flatiron School software engineering boot camp. 

During this boot camp I hope to learn the basics of software engineering so perhaps in the future I’ll be able to create software capable of solving some of the issues facing the world. If there is a problem, let’s hope there is a solution. So, let’s open up our IDE and start building an ideal world. We won’t succeed unless we try.
